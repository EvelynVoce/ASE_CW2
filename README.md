# Haskell Dictionary implementation using a BST

This goal of this project was to create a Dictionary module that encapsulates an internal implementation that uses a BST to perform polymorphic functionality.
Development was to be conducted following test-driven development and would use a combination of unit tests and property-based tests.

Skills:
- Test-Driven Development
- Haskell
- Functional Programming (Lambdas, pattern matching, etc)
